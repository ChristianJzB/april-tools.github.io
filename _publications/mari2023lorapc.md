excerpt: "We disentangle the few structural choices that can characterize the performance of modern circuit architectures in terms of expressiveness and computational complexity."
abstract: "Tensorizing probabilistic circuits (PCs) -- structured computational graphs capable of efficiently and accurately performing various probabilistic reasoning tasks -- is the go-to way to represent and learn these models. This paper systematically explores the architectural options employed in modern overparameterized PCs, namely RAT-SPNs, EiNets, and HCLTs, and unifies them into a single algorithmic framework. By trying to compress the existing overparameterized layers via low-rank decompositions, we discover alternative parameterizations that possess the same expressive power but are computationally more efficient. This emphasizes the possibility of “mixing & matching” different design choices to create new PCs and helps to disentangle the few ones that really matter."
